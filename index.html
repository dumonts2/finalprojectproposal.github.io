    <h1>MUSIC TIME MACHINE</h1>
<p>I will be making a website that simulates a musical time machine. <br> From the homepage, a user would be able to click on era’s such as: (70’s,80’s,90’s) and from there the page would change using javascript to transform the layout.<br> Albums would be shown using whatever medium was used in that era such as: (CD's, Vinyls, Spotify). <br> The example sketch shown below is what I have in mind for such a concept:
